<ul>
  <li>Rust is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing performance , type safety , and concurrency . It enforces memory safety , meaning that all references point to valid memory. It does so without a conventional garbage collector ; instead, memory safety errors and data races are prevented by the “borrow checker”, which tracks the object lifetime of references at compile time .</li>
</ul>
