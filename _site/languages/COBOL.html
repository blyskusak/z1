 —# COBOL</p>

<ul>
  <li>COBOL ( / ˈ k oʊ b ɒ l , - b ɔː l / ; an acronym for “common business-oriented language”) is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use. It is an imperative , procedural , and, since 2002, object-oriented language. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in applications deployed on mainframe computers , such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. Many large financial institutions were developing new systems in the language as late as 2006, [ 10 ] but most programming in COBOL today is purely to maintain existing applications. Programs are being moved to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages, or replaced with other software. [ 11 ]</li>
