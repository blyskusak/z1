- Kotlin ( / ˈ k ɒ t l ɪ n / ) [ 2 ] is a cross-platform , statically typed , general-purpose high-level programming language with type inference . Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java , and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library ,
but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React ) [ 3 ] or native code via LLVM (e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps). [ 4 ] Language development costs are borne by JetBrains , while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark. [ 5 ]
