 ---# Ada

- Ada is a structured , statically typed , imperative , and object-oriented high-level programming language , inspired by Pascal and other languages. It has built-in language support for design by contract (DbC), extremely strong typing , explicit concurrency, tasks, synchronous message passing , protected objects , and non-determinism . Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors. Ada is an international technical standard , jointly defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). As of May 2023 [update] , the standard, ISO/IEC 8652:2023, is called Ada 2022 informally. [ 11 ]
